          Ontology as a branch of philosophy is the science of what is, of the
          kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes, and
          relations in every area of reality. “Ontology” is often used by
          philosophers as a synonym of “metaphysics”.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          An ontology is a formal description of knowledge as a set of concepts
          within a domain and the relationships that hold between them. To
          enable such a description, we need to formally specify components such
          as individuals (instances of objects), classes, attributes and
          relations as well as restrictions, rules and axioms. As a result,
          ontologies do not only introduce a sharable and reusable knowledge
          representation but can also add new knowledge about the domain. It
          ensures a common understanding of information and makes explicit
          domain assumptions thus allowing organizations to make better sense of
          their data.

        <div>
          In computer science, ontology refers to a formal representation of a
          domain of knowledge or a conceptual model that defines a set of
          concepts and the relationships between them, often represented in a
          hierarchical structure or graph. Ontologies are used in fields such as
          artificial intelligence, knowledge management, and the semantic web to
          enable the sharing and reuse of knowledge across different
          applications and domains.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          The ontology data model can be applied to a set of individual facts to
          create a knowledge graph – a collection of entities, where the types
          and the relationships between them are expressed by nodes and edges
          between these nodes, By describing the structure of the knowledge in a
          domain, the ontology sets the stage for the knowledge graph to capture
          the data in it.
        </div>
        <br />

        If we bring back the definition of formal ontology from above, and then
        we think of data and information, it’s possible to set up a framework to
        study data and its relation to other data. In this framework we
        represent information in an especially useful way. Information
        represented in a particular formal ontology can be more easily
        accessible to automated information processing, and how best to do this
        is an active area of research in computer science like data science. The
        use of the formal ontology here is representational. It is a framework
        to represent information, and as such it can be representationally
        successful whether or not the formal theory used in fact truly describes
        a domain of entities.

        />
        <div>
          Ontology seeks to provide a definitive and exhaustive classification
          of entities in all spheres of being. The classification should be
          definitive in the sense that it can serve as an answer to such
          questions as: What classes of entities are needed for a complete
          description and explanation of all the goings-on in the universe? Or:
          What classes of entities are needed to give an account of what makes
          true all truths? It should be exhaustive in the sense that all types
          of entities should be included in the classification, including also
          the types of relations by which entities are tied together to form
          larger wholes.&nbsp;

        <div>
          <b>Methods of Ontology:</b>&nbsp; The methods of ontology – henceforth
          in philosophical contexts always used in the adequatist sense – are
          the methods of philosophy in general. They include the development of
          theories of wider or narrower scope and the testing and refinement of
          such theories by measuring them up, either against difficult
          counter-examples or against the results of science. These methods were
          familiar already to Aristotle himself. In the course of the twentieth
          century a range of new formal tools became available to ontologists
          for the development and testing of their theories. Ontologists
          nowadays have a choice of formal frameworks (deriving from algebra,
          category theory, mereology, set theory, topology) in terms of which
          their theories can be formulated. These new formal tools, along with
          the language of formal logic, can in principle allow philosophers to
          express intuitive ideas and definitions in clear and rigorous fashion,
          and, through the application of the methods of formal semantics, they
          can allow also for the testing of theories for logical consistency and
          completeness.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          To create effective representations it is an advantage if one knows
          something about the things and processes one is trying to represent.
          (We might call this the Ontologist’s Credo.) The attempt to satisfy
          this credo has led philosophers to be maximally opportunistic in the
          sources they have drawn upon in their ontological explorations of
          reality and in their ontological theorizing.

          <b>Ontology and Information Science:</b> In a related development,
          also hardly noticed by philosophers, the term “ontology” has gained
          currency in recent years in the field of computer and information
          science (Welty &amp; Smith 2001). The big task for the new “ontology”
          derives from what we might call the Tower of Babel problem. Different
          groups of data- and knowledgebase system designers have their own
          idiosyncratic terms and concepts by means of which they build
          frameworks for information representation. Different databases may use
          identical labels but with different meanings; alternatively the same
          meaning may be expressed via different names. As ever more diverse
          groups are involved in sharing and translating ever more diverse
          varieties of information, the problems standing in the way of putting
          this information together within a single system increase
          geometrically. Methods must be found to resolve the terminological and
          conceptual incompatibilities which then inevitably arise. Initially,
          such incompatibilities were resolved on a case-by-case basis.
          Gradually, however, it was recognized that the provision, once and for
          all, of a common reference ontology – a shared taxonomy of entities –
          might provide significant advantages over such case-by-case
          resolution, and the term “ontology” came to be used by information
          scientists to describe the construction of a canonical description of
          this sort. An ontology is in this context a dictionary of terms
          formulated in a canonical syntax and with commonly accepted
          definitions designed to yield a lexical or taxonomical framework for
          knowledge representation which can be shared by different
          information-systems communities. More ambitiously, an ontology is a
          formal theory within which not only definitions but also a supporting
          framework of axioms is included (perhaps the axioms themselves provide
          implicit definitions of the terms involved). The methods used in the
          construction of ontologies thus conceived are derived on the one hand
          from earlier initiatives in database management systems. But they also
          include methods similar to those employed in philosophy (as described
          in Hayes 1985), including the methods used by logicians when
          developing formal semantic theories.&nbsp;
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          The potential advantages of ontology thus conceived for the purposes
          of information management are obvious. Each group of data analysts
          would need to perform the task of making its terms and concepts
          compatible with those of other such groups only once – by calibrating
          its results in the terms of the single canonical backbone language. If
          all databases were calibrated in terms of just one common ontology (a
          single consistent, stable, and highly expressive set of category
          labels), then the prospect would arise of leveraging the thousands of
          person-years of effort that have been invested in creating separate
          database resources in such a way as to create, in more or less
          automatic fashion, a single integrated knowledge base of a scale
          hitherto unimagined, thus fulfilling an ancient philosophical dream of
          a Great Encyclopedia comprehending all knowledge within a single
          system.
